title: Spaces — Isolated Workspaces
description: Spaces let you organize MCP servers into isolated environments with separate credentials. Keep work, personal, and client projects completely separated in McpMux.
---

Spaces are isolated workspaces in McpMux. Each Space has its own server configurations, credentials, and enabled servers — keeping different contexts completely separate.

## Why Spaces

Without Spaces, all your MCP credentials and server configurations live in a single shared context. This means:

- Your work GitHub token is accessible alongside personal projects
- Client credentials from different customers can leak across contexts
- Switching between project contexts requires manual reconfiguration
- There's no way to limit which servers are available for which work

Spaces solve this by providing **complete isolation** between environments.

## How Spaces Work

Each Space is an independent environment containing:

- **Installed servers** — which MCP servers are available in this Space
- **Server configurations** — per-Space credentials, environment variables, and settings
- **FeatureSets** — permission bundles scoped to this Space
- **Client grants** — which FeatureSets each AI client gets in this Space

### Active Space

Only one Space can be **active** at a time. The active Space determines:

- Which servers the gateway connects to
- Which tools AI clients can see and use (for clients in "Follow Active" mode)
- Which credentials are injected into server connections

Switching the active Space immediately changes what servers and tools are available — no restart required.

### Default-Enabled Servers

When you install a server, you can mark it as **default-enabled**. Default-enabled servers are automatically available in all Spaces without needing to install them individually. This is useful for universal tools like Filesystem or Brave Search that you want everywhere.

## Common Space Configurations

### Work vs Personal

The most common setup separates work and personal contexts:

| | Work Space | Personal Space |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub | Work org token | Personal token |
| Slack | Company workspace | — |
| AWS | Production credentials | Personal account |
| Notion | Team workspace | Personal workspace |

### Multi-Client Freelancing

Freelancers and consultants can create a Space per client:

- **Client-Alpha** — their GitHub, Jira, and Slack
- **Client-Beta** — their GitHub and Linear
- **Personal** — your own tools and projects

Each client's credentials are completely isolated. There's no risk of accidentally using Client-Alpha's API key while working on Client-Beta.

### Dev / Staging / Prod

For operations work, separate Spaces prevent accidentally running production commands:

- **Development** — local services, test databases
- **Staging** — staging API keys, staging databases
- **Production** — production credentials (used sparingly and intentionally)

## Managing Spaces

### Creating a Space

Navigate to **Spaces** in McpMux and click **Create Space**. Give it a name and optional icon.

### Switching Active Space

Click on any Space to set it as active. The dashboard and server list update immediately to reflect the new context. AI clients using "Follow Active" mode switch automatically.

### Deleting a Space

Deleting a Space removes all its server configurations and stored credentials. This action is irreversible. The servers themselves (their definitions) remain in the registry — only the per-Space installation and credentials are deleted.

- [Set up Clients](/docs/clients/) with connection modes that interact with Spaces
- [Manage Servers](/docs/servers/) to install and configure per-Space server instances
