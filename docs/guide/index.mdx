## The Problem

Every AI-powered development tool — Cursor, Claude Desktop, VS Code, Windsurf, ChatGPT, JetBrains — requires its own MCP server configuration. This means:

- **Duplicate configurations** across every tool, each with slightly different JSON formats
- **Plaintext credentials** scattered in config files on disk
- **No access control** — every client sees every tool from every server
- **Manual context switching** when moving between work, personal, and client projects
- **No visibility** into which servers are connected or what tools are available

## The Solution

**McpMux** is a free, open-source desktop app that solves all of these problems. Configure your MCP servers once in McpMux, then connect every AI client through a single `localhost:45818` endpoint.

```
AI Clients (Cursor, Claude, VS Code, …)
        ↓
McpMux Gateway (localhost:45818/mcp)
        ↓
MCP Servers (GitHub, Slack, PostgreSQL, …)
```

McpMux sits between your AI clients and your MCP servers. It handles:

- **Routing** — directs each MCP request to the correct server
- **Authentication** — manages OAuth tokens, API keys, and credentials
- **Permissions** — controls which tools each client can access via FeatureSets
- **Encryption** — stores all credentials with AES-256-GCM in the OS keychain
- **Isolation** — separates environments with Spaces (work, personal, client projects)

## Key Concepts

### [Spaces](/docs/spaces/)

Isolated workspaces with separate server configurations and credentials. Keep your work GitHub token completely separate from your personal one.

### [FeatureSets](/docs/feature-sets/)

Permission bundles that control which MCP tools, resources, and prompts each AI client can access. Create read-only views, role-based access, or domain-specific bundles.

### [Clients](/docs/clients/)

AI applications connected to McpMux. Configure connection modes (follow active Space, lock to a Space, or ask on change) and assign permissions per Space.

### [Servers](/docs/servers/)

MCP servers installed and managed through McpMux. Supports both local stdio servers and remote HTTP endpoints with automatic credential injection.

### [Gateway](/docs/gateway/)

The local HTTP server running on `localhost:45818` that routes MCP requests, manages OAuth tokens, filters tools by permissions, and pools server connections.

## Supported Clients

McpMux works with every MCP-compatible AI client:

- **Cursor** — AI code editor
