title: FeatureSets — Permission Control
description: FeatureSets control which MCP tools, resources, and prompts each AI client can access in McpMux. Create role-based permissions, domain bundles, or read-only views.
---

FeatureSets are permission bundles that control what MCP capabilities (tools, resources, and prompts) each AI client can access. They let you grant fine-grained permissions per client, per Space.

## Why FeatureSets

Without permission control, every AI client connected through the gateway can access every tool from every server. This creates risks:

- A junior developer's client could access destructive database tools
- An experimental AI agent could call deployment tools
- A read-only analysis tool could accidentally modify production data

FeatureSets solve this by letting you define exactly what each client can do.

## FeatureSet Types

McpMux creates and manages four types of FeatureSets:

### All

Grants access to **every tool, resource, and prompt** from every connected server in the Space. Use this for fully trusted clients.

### Default

Automatically granted to **all clients** in the Space. Define a baseline set of capabilities that every client gets. You can still add more FeatureSets on top for specific clients.

### ServerAll

Automatically created when a server first connects. Grants access to **all features from that specific server**. For example, when you enable the GitHub server, McpMux creates a "GitHub — All" FeatureSet containing all of GitHub's tools and resources.

### Custom

User-defined FeatureSets with manually selected features. This is where you build your own permission bundles.

## Include and Exclude

Each FeatureSet member can be set to **include** or **exclude** mode:

- **Include** — add this tool/resource/prompt to the set
- **Exclude** — remove this tool/resource/prompt from the set

Exclude rules always win over include rules. This means you can create a permissive base and then remove specific dangerous tools:

**Example:** "All GitHub except delete operations"
1. Include the **GitHub — All** ServerAll FeatureSet
2. Exclude `delete_repository`, `delete_branch`, `delete_file`

## Composition

FeatureSets can **contain other FeatureSets**. This lets you build hierarchical permission structures:

- **"Read Only"** = Include tools that only read data from multiple servers
- **"Android Development"** = Include "GitHub — All" + "Firebase — All" + specific Gradle tools
- **"Senior Developer"** = Include "All" but exclude deployment and infrastructure tools
- **"Intern"** = Include "Read Only" + specific write tools for their assigned project

## Common Use Cases

### Role-Based Access

| FeatureSet | Contains |
|-----------|----------|
| Read Only | Search, list, and read tools only |
| Developer | Read Only + code editing + PR management |
| DevOps | Developer + deployment + infrastructure |
| Admin | All capabilities |

### Domain Bundles

| FeatureSet | Contains |
|-----------|----------|
| Frontend | Browser tools + CSS/JS linting + design system resources |
| Backend | Database queries + API testing + log analysis |
| Full Stack | Frontend + Backend |

### Safety Limits

| FeatureSet | Contains |
|-----------|----------|
| No Delete | All minus any delete/remove/drop operations |
| No Deploy | All minus CI/CD and deployment tools |
| Sandbox | Only filesystem (read) + search + documentation |

## Managing FeatureSets

### Creating a Custom FeatureSet

1. Go to the **FeatureSets** page
2. Click **Create FeatureSet**
3. Give it a name and optional description
4. Add members — select features or other FeatureSets
5. Set each member to include or exclude mode

### Assigning to Clients

FeatureSets are assigned to clients per Space. Go to the **Clients** page, select a client, and manage its FeatureSet grants for each Space.

A client's effective permissions are the combination of all its granted FeatureSets, with exclude rules taking priority.
